This repository contains tutorial implementations of SDL programs in C++,
following the tutorial at 
[Beginning Game Programming](http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php).

Examples:

ShowImage - displays an image in a 640x480 window for 2 seconds.
Usage: ./ShowImage imageFileName
Default image is used if imageFileName is unspecified

ShowBackground - displays two images above a tiled background image, with
color-keyed transparency on one of them.  Uses event handling to close
window when window close button is clicked.
Usage: ./ShowBackground

Scrolling - as for ShowBackground, but now with a window that can be
scrolled over a lager area than displayed onscreen.
Usage: ./Scrolling
Arrow keys to scroll, q to quit.
